# Data Literacy, Pandas Library & Exploration Data Analysis(EDA)

In this section we will cover the topics such as; how to handle and process the data, how to read it, how to visualize the data, what can we deduct from a dataset after the processes that we made and at the end we apply EDA(Exploration Data Analysis) on a valid dataset.
